## 🧱 Setup the Folder Structure

**Git Repository:**  
[https://github.com/Restaurant-Project-UOK/No_18_restaurant-MS.git](https://github.com/Restaurant-Project-UOK/No_18_restaurant-MS.git)

1. Create a new branch from the **development** branch as dev_<your_name>

  ```

You must have an empty project folder before starting your setup.

Go to your respective folders, make your updates, and then create a Pull Request (PR) to the main branch when ready.
